# 🩺 Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

This project is part of my internship at **SystemTron** – **Task 4**. It aims to detect whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** using machine learning, based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset.

## 📌 Project Overview

- 💻 Built using **Python** and **Google Colab**
- 🔍 Used a **Random Forest Classifier** for high accuracy
- 📊 Visualized key features affecting tumor classification
- ✅ Achieved over **95% accuracy**

---

## 📁 Dataset

- The dataset used is `data.csv`, provided as part of the internship resources.
- It includes medical measurements like radius, texture, smoothness, etc.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Dataset is cleaned and preprocessed
2. Features and labels are separated
3. Data is split into training and testing sets
4. A Random Forest model is trained
5. Predictions are made and evaluated
6. Confusion matrix and feature importance are plotted

---

## 📈 Output Visuals

- **Confusion Matrix**  
- **Feature Importance Plot**

These help in understanding model performance and which features matter most.

---

## 🧠 Model Accuracy

> Achieved an accuracy of **95%+**, with clear distinction between malignant and benign tumors.
